    <section class="introduction">
        <h2>How to Prepare for Your First Flight 📝</h2>
        <p>Flying for the first time can be exciting 😄 but also a little overwhelming 😅. Don't worry, we're here to help you with all the details you'll need to know!</p>
        
        <h3>1. Check Your Documents 📑</h3>
        <p>Before you head to the airport, make sure you have all the necessary documents ready:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Passport/ID:</strong> If you are flying internationally, ensure your passport is valid for at least six months. For domestic flights, your ID is enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Flight Tickets:</strong> Have a printed copy or an electronic copy on your phone. Many airlines have mobile apps where you can check-in and store your boarding pass digitally.</li>
            <li><strong>Visa/Other Travel Documents:</strong> Check if your destination requires a visa or any other travel documentation (like a vaccination certificate). 📄💼</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Arrive Early 🕓</h3>
        <p>Arriving at the airport with plenty of time is essential:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Domestic Flights:</strong> Arrive 2 hours before departure to ensure you have time for check-in and security checks.</li>
            <li><strong>For International Flights:</strong> It's recommended to arrive 3 hours early. International flights often require additional checks, such as passport control and customs inspections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🛃 The earlier you arrive, the less stress you'll have. Airports can get crowded, especially during peak hours, so give yourself enough time!</p>

        <h3>3. Pack Smart 🎒</h3>
        <p>What you pack can make your flight experience much more comfortable. Here's a checklist to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essentials:</strong> Don’t forget your charger 🔌, snacks 🍫, a book 📚 or magazine 📰 for entertainment, and your headphones 🎧.</li>
            <li><strong>Flight Comfort:</strong> A neck pillow 🛏️, a blanket (if allowed), and comfy clothes 👕 can make a long flight more comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Health & Safety:</strong> Pack any necessary medications 💊, hand sanitizer 🧴, and face masks 😷 (if required).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Go Through Security 🚨</h3>
        <p>The security screening is one of the most important parts of your airport experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Liquids:</strong> You’ll need to put all liquids in a small, clear bag and follow the 100ml rule for each liquid bottle 🧴.</li>
            <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Laptops, tablets, and sometimes even phones 📱 must be taken out of your bag for inspection.</li>
            <li><strong>Clothing & Shoes:</strong> You may need to remove your shoes 👠👟, belts, or jackets 🧥 during the security process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't worry though! The security staff will guide you through each step, and it's all for your safety 🛡️.</p>

        <h3>5. Understand Your Boarding Pass 🎫</h3>
        <p>Your boarding pass is like a treasure map to help you navigate the airport:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gate:</strong> The boarding pass will list your departure gate 📍, so make sure to check the monitors at the airport for any updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Boarding Time:</strong> Your boarding pass will tell you when to line up 🕔 to board the plane. Make sure to be there on time!</li>
            <li><strong>Seat Number:</strong> Find your seat number so you can locate your spot on the plane 📍💺.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Safety First 🔒</h3>
        <p>Flying can feel a bit daunting, but know that air travel is one of the safest modes of transportation 🚀. Pay attention to the flight attendants as they go over safety instructions 👨‍✈️. They will demonstrate how to use the seatbelt, oxygen masks 😷, and emergency exits 🚪. Stay calm and follow their guidance.</p>

        <p>Feeling nervous? 😟 It's completely normal. Just relax, take a deep breath, and enjoy the experience! 🌟 You’ll be landing safely before you know it! 😊</p>
